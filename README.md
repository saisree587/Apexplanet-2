Thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed Task 2 of the ApexPlanet Internship, where I honed my skills in:
âœ… HTML & CSS: Structuring and styling web pages with precision, ensuring seamless responsiveness across devices.
âœ… JavaScript: Implementing dynamic interactions, enhancing user experiences, and mastering efficient form validation techniques.
âœ… Debugging & Problem-Solving: Tackling challenges head-on, refining code structure, and optimizing functionality.
âœ… UI/UX Design Thinking: Prioritizing intuitive user interfaces and accessibility for an enhanced digital experience.
This task pushed me to think critically, write cleaner code, and approach development with a problem-solving mindset. Excited to apply these skills to bigger projects and continue growing in the tech space!
